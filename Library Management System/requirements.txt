# Library Management System Requirements
# This project uses only Python standard library modules
# No external dependencies required

# Python version requirement
# Python 3.7+ recommended for better type hints support

# Standard library modules used:
# - json (for data persistence)
# - csv (for CSV export functionality - optional)
